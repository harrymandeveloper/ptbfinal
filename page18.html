            <p>His house had a pool and a basketball hoop, and I went there when grown-ups were fighting. Along the wall there were cages of birds, and the birds would sing from the cages. When the sun hid its face under cloud-cover, they stopped. Singing. Each time. My aunty told me the birds got confused, that they thought the sun had wilted and died, that night had come early and snuffed it. That the birds were afraid of what might go down if the sun never visited again. That isn’t true. Someone else once told me that birds thread together the world when they sing, and if they stop it comes unstitched. That isn’t true, but it’s nice. Sometimes the truth is not good. The truth is that birds can live longer than boys. The truth is his birds did. I watched as they outlived him. They watched themselves outlive him too, and never broke their song. The sun stayed brazenly away from the clouds, and the songbirds were cheerful and would not ssh. Outside the fish sellers called out their catch. The world retained its stitches. I sat with the birds as he splashed and splashed and the waves of the pool levelled out in his lungs. The birds were born before he was. They lived to be fourteen years old. When they died, my aunty called on the phone and told me something had happened. That she’d gone to put seed in their cages and all of them flew out. Up to the sky, to the clouds, up to make friends with the sun. Look up and maybe you’ll see them. They’d said the same to her when he died, that his spirit had slipped its cage. In the shed she kept the bicycle that was for his next birthday, which came and went without him. She’d have kept it to this day, I think, but the shed was broken into and robbed, and some child somewhere else must now have it, or probably it was melted for scrap. All the while I stayed mute at the rectangle’s edge, listening to the splashing get softer and the birdsong stay the same volume, and something was blocking my throat. The only creature for miles around that didn’t know how to call out.</p>
