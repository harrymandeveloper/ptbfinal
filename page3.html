            <p>The town I grew up in no longer exists. The buildings are there but the name has changed, and you can no longer find it on maps. There was an estuary, and a minor beach with sticky sand that lay over the road from my house. In storms the estuary flooded and covered the road with slowness, with murky flat reflections. When the tide was out it smelled like rotting, the mud, and the river was so small in the middle it made the sea look parched and thirsty. In the evenings men sat on the wall and dipped their rods and fished. They’d catch enough for their supper and sell any extra, door to door on rusted bikes. My house was next to the yacht club on the left. They electrified their fence to stop break-ins, and when the wind picked up the trees in our yard would bash the wires and cause them to spark. The house on the right was levelled for a sea-front restaurant, but the developers ran out of funds. They left a mass of rubble and the homeless came for miles. At first they came looking for copper to sell, then used the bricks to build rough shelters. Most nights was the smell of cooking fish and the sound of bottles opening. Raucous laughter sometimes, or smashed glass fighting till the red sun rose. Around the corner lived my aunt, her husband and her son. When grown-ups were angry or arguing, I was free to walk the block. My aunt had a pool and kept songbirds. The birds would sing nicely as I sat by the pool and waved my feet through the wet, never quite daring to enter. My aunt had seven children, they all arrived stillborn. The eighth one lived three years, ten months. The ninth and tenth then failed. After ten she stopped trying. A still birth needs a grave, and a funeral, and a name. It all adds up. The cost. That was all a long time ago now, back when the town existed. One by one, the songbirds died. The pool was filled with cement. Even those men and their bicycles are gone. The town was no town but a village. Anyway, it doesn’t exist.</p>
