            <p>At a bar I find drunks and I pin them. Hey, I say, answer this: what’s the difference between a swimming pool, just your standard back yard pool, what’s the difference between that and a grave? I tell them it’s a riddle. I tell them it’s a joke. Don’t worry, you’ll get it one day. One of these days you’ll laugh. The counter is black veneer with sparkly bits inside. Small flies dip noiselessly into drops of spilled liquor and get themselves piss-drunk. I’m a laugher, me. I laugh when it isn’t okay. At my cousin’s funeral, I tell them, that whole day I laughed. Jaw dropped cackle, like a psychopath’s doll. I dig my thumb in a rubber mat, swivel on a plush chrome stool. Oh, I didn’t mention? Yes, my cousin died. A total accident, no-one’s fault. He tripped and fell into a grave. Most nights I dream underwater. I hold my breath in my sleep. When I wake up I’m gasping for air, and my porous body has sweated and pissed. Like a sponge squeezed tight by a fist. My greatest fear, I tell them, that’s it. I’m scared of, well I guess, in truth, of anything that’s liquid. The tumbler of whiskey rolls in my hand. Not when it’s alcoholic though, sheesh, put a star on the flag because I am a STATE. I was born in water, the irony is. Born in a bathtub, I tell them. The umbilical cord enwrapped my neck and choked me half to death. Since then I’ve always felt… Enwrapped! A tightness all around. Calm yourself down by anchoring your breath, only what if breathing kills you? My elbow on the counter slips, I act like it’s deliberate. Well that’s just it, I don’t know how to swim. I can’t even really tread water. Okay, what’re you having, the next round’s on me. Drowning, that was it, the way my cousin went. So went Shelley, so went Woolf. In the middle of my life there’s a rectangle, I say, the colour and shape of a pool. One time I walked on the overpass. I clambered onto the concrete wall, the headlights streaming beneath me. Arms outstretched like a bird in flight, and I never felt more power than then, when the drivers below all blasted their horns and I was the core point of focus. Shit! Where’s my card? Guess this one’s on you. I tell them it’s my cousin’s birthday, whatever day it is. He’d be twenty one years old. Today! I’m drinking this for him.</p>
