            <p>Afternoon by the river’s edge. The river rolls over the algae-green stones, and isn’t deep at all. People sit and the water flows over their feet, the sun on closed-eye faces. Further out it swells and deepens. Girls lie on their backs drifting slowly, or kick their legs to best the current. A grown man splashes water their way in a desperate attempt to flirt. I stand in the river up to my ribs and watch as my breathing gets shallow. There were times in school where we practised. I walked on the bottom as far as I could and splashed my arms to pretend I was swimming. When the water pressed against my lips, when it sloshed in my ear I would panic. The pool growing warm with my piss. They used plastic toys as incentives in school. Threw them out and said to collect them. I held on tight to the tiled edge and cried and shook my head. They threw a toy shark and I wailed so hard they dragged me out and sent me home. There’s pollen on the river’s surface, a bile coloured scum riding over small waves, distorting the willow’s reflection. And now I am becoming aware of it. A long drawn scream sounding out from my throat. A scream so loud the adults have turned, and some are walking over. Sunglasses removed from their faces, their eyebrows tight with confusion. A scream so loud the birds fall mute. So loud they can hear it a hemisphere away, in a town that doesn’t exist. And I’m there and I’m three and I’m screaming. A hoard of grown-ups come running at the sound, they rush in and see the water. The way it’s jerking up and down. All the fish sellers too have abandoned their bikes, wheels spinning with a rusted squeak. There lies the rectangle in all its depth, and to them it isn’t big, and there’s time, and they jump right in and save him. The wet tiles shimmer in the brilliant sun as they drag him sputtering away from his end. And all the songbirds gossip about what a strange thing they’ve heard, a scream that came twenty years late. On his fourth birthday he tears off the wrapping and finds his first bike, and spends all day learning to ride it. I sit there sulking but that’s okay, because the rectangle doesn’t exist here, and the scream is long forgotten. The afternoon’s river runs over the stones, and kids are diving under. Seconds later, they resurface. Impossible, inevitable, as natural as that. And the craneflies and mayflies that live for a day rise and resettle, lazy in the heat, with the attitude of much time to spare.
