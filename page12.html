            <p>Mexico in July. I’d packed expecting heat, and looked ridiculous in shorts and a nylon shirt as fat rain sloshed from the gutters. I kept a journal of the thunder that summer. In the blank front pages of the books I read, I wrote accounts of watching the rain. Waiting, expectant, to glimpse it, the flash, waiting so long that whenever it happened I was inevitably doing something else– watching my sulky reflection blend with the raindrops pelting tears on the glass, looking down at the steam rising from a warm herbal tea, closing my eyes in thought until the lightening illuminated the inside of my eyelid with its warm red knot of veins.<i> Flashes through the blue-black night in brief exposures, camera-like and distant.</i> Something about thunder, the delay of it, that sudden disjuncture between cause and effect. A call which comes too late. <i>It’s my last day in Philadelphia, the thunder is keeping the whole hostel awake, a homeless man is pacing and swearing and challenging Zeus to a fight.</i> And then I’d send it off. The book. I’d leave it in some public place or mail it to a friend, and I’d buy a new one to read and when the next storm hit I’d describe it. The last storm I watched was in the US. I sat on the coast of Lake Champlain on a warm and breezeless late-summer night looking at the lights of Montreal that glimmered on the converse edge, the long-drawn wavering lights like paint smudged out towards me. Dark clouds were in the air above me too, but they moved, or seemed to, double-time towards the city, massing on Canada’s border where a thunderstorm silently sparked. So breathless, almost, to see it– to know that across the water people held umbrellas and lurched for taxis, stood shivering on corners in sodden shoes waiting for the streetlights to change, or curled under blankets listening to the thrashing wet. All the chaotic noise of it failed to cross between nations, but I could see it still, far off, the myriad personal tumults both close and abstractly distant. Like when you’re in an aeroplane forty thousand feet up, leaving, for the first time, a town that doesn’t exist, and passing over Egypt you see beneath you the clouds lighting up from below. And you don’t know why it’s happening so you tug at your sleeping mother and through a tired bleary croak she tells you down there it’s raining, down there on the pyramids it’s raining, and it reminds you, somehow, of what it must be like to ride your rusted bike past a tragedy and never even know.</p>
