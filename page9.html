            <p>In the aftermath of Thomas’ death, grown-ups began acting strange. My mother ran baths very shallow and would not leave my side. My uncle stopped going to work every day and forgot how to stand without swaying. I asked my aunt for Thomas’ toys, since clearly he wouldn’t need them. I couldn’t understand why she slapped me. The injustice I felt when she gave them away, to kids at a school for orphans. I pictured the orphans with his plastic shark, their whoops and hoots of laughter. Somewhere, deep down, I didn’t care he was dead. There was a tortoise in the church yard the day of the wake, and I force fed it cheese puffs and cake. My mother grabbed me and hissed. <i>Stop laughing</i>. My uncle gave me a balloon. On the way home I let go of it, and for the first time I cried, because I lost my balloon. <i>Stop.</i> Adults sat me down for serious chats and told me it was fine to be sad. That it was ok to cry, in fact normal. I wasn’t in the slightest bit sad. Except about toys going to orphans. What I do recall is <i>Laughing.</i> Attention. I basked in the pity they gave me. And as the years passed and it came to dry up, I learned how to wrangle it back. It was the gift that never stopped giving. If I told an adult I wanted to die, they dropped everything and made me feel special. They gave me kisses and sweeties and toys, and played with my hair very nicely. I heard myself say it so often. <i>All I want is to not be living.</i> And now I bark at therapists that nothing is ever my fault. You don’t understand what I went through. It broke me to the core. Nothing is ever– Look!– none of this is me.</p>
