            <p>On a beach in summer. Wet sand hard, soft sand hot, the air all close and sticky. Sticky, too, the salt on my trunks, the salt left over when the water dries up. It stiffens the hem of my swim trunks and scratches my leg when I walk. Coiled knots of muddy lugworms. I dig my feet where the water swells, my ankle ringed in brine. When the tide rides out, the wet sand sucks my toes. Further up the beach, amidst the parasols and deck chairs and spread-out towels and clumps of spiky grasses, barbecues are lit. Small disposable grills, the burning wafts my way before the sea breeze shoves it back. In the distance windsurfers go left to right, left to right, and back. Wet heads bob like seals in the wash. The slight wind throws their voices to shore before the crash of a fresh wave buries them. If I’m ever in some blue lit room, where a life-coach lights joss sticks and hums and asks me to imagine a place where I’m safe, this is the place I’ll conjure. Where every wave breaks and summons its strength and breaks and breaks again, where swimmers swim and go nowhere. It’s not that I feel safe here. This place where kids run up and down on the beach and the ocean knocks them over. Where silver fire pits sizzle under grease, and guff anoxic fumes. It’s more that I feel a great stasis. The waves wash fragments of sea-glass to shore, and I throw them out, and back they wash. Here, where movement goes nowhere. Where the story never progresses, but washes fragments at your feet for inspection.</p>
