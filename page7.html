            <p>There’s that joke in the movie, isn’t there? Where the man says I have a drinking problem then throws a glass of water at his face. Like that. Not a problem with alcohol– although, yes, that too, much later, yes– I mean literally a problem drinking. My mother explained it badly. I only drank with a straw after that, or this blue and yellow plastic spoon that came free in a box of cereal and for a while was my favourite thing. She ran the tap and cupped the flow. <i>This is all it takes</i>. I had a swimming instructor– me in arm-bands, he a teen– and after each session he took me out for a lap on his back. I loved it, I think, though all I remember is how it ended, how I cried like I thought he would kill me. He was young and had no clue. I think I pissed on his back. But wait, let’s start this again. In my first year of college, I walked past a building on fire. Everything was under control. People shivered in blankets for shock as firefighters unrolled the hose, and I wanted suddenly to run inside, to lock myself in the bathroom and sit under the showerhead soaking until the floor below was weak with ash and everything came plummeting down. Do you follow? That was three hours after the three hours before, when I cried for no reason in the therapist’s lounge, and then went out and got the drunkest I’ve got, not ever, but after AA– for no reason. Drowning your sorrows? Har har. Shut up. So what if tears are water. That night, too, I broke my front teeth, but look, I’m getting distracted. There was a reason, wasn’t there? For those horrible watery sobs. Like repression or deflection or just feeling overwhelmed. I told her I felt like a child. <i>Would you say you feel like you’re drowning?</i> Yes, like a drowning– Fuck. And I walked straight out and went to the store, bought a half-litre of vodka and necked it, right there in the liquid dark, the falling shades of blue to black like layers of going under. He’d wanted to be a fireman, which wasn’t very original. He was too young to be very original. The therapist tapped her pen on the desk like the click of my aunty’s teeth on his as she failed at CPR. So what for originality? It comes with living wrong.</p>
