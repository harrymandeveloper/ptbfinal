            <p>Gagarin in sixty one, rocket-shot into Low Earth Orbit. <i>The Earth is blue,</i> he said. <i>Amazing, beautiful blue.</i> Or words to that effect. Astronauts train underwater, fumbling tools in the mock low-gravity. They didn’t have specialist facilities at first. They booked sessions in a local pool. Picture it: the aqua aerobics class runs five minutes late, a gaggle of trainees in space suits wait shiftily at the edge, checking watches and boredly sighing. On Sundays I go to the swimming pool, I go as soon as it opens. I’m usually with septagenarians, they swim laps up and down while I cling to the rope and practice kicking my legs. An hour later there’s a class for mothers. They place their newborns in the shallows and gently turn them over, so they learn how to float on their backs. A baby up to six months old knows to hold its breath, a reflex they later forget. Three days before the day Thomas drowned, I tripped and fell face-forward into a rock pool by the beach. My head went down and didn’t come out. It wasn’t like I was floating, the pool was not overly deep, but I lay there face-down and stopped moving. My mother came running over, scooped me up and dried me off. <i>Why didn’t you lift your head?</i> I told her I tried but couldn’t. Toddlers’ heads are heavy and sink. They spiral, spinning, weightless as spacemen. Their heads are big because their brains are big and their bodies are small and they struggle. On the day Thomas drowned they found me next to the pool. I sat there picking my nose. Thomas was floating the slow perimeter as the pump induced a soft current. I’d shit my pants and pissed myself, but still I was picking my nose. That night my mother asked me, <i>Why didn’t you call for help?</i> I struggled to answer at first, because my answer was the same. I told her I tried but couldn’t. As though I was sitting in the vacuum of space, where sound refused to move. In the months that followed, my aunt turned to God. She saw it as sacrificial, the way Abraham held a knife against Isaac. Even her pastor was worried. <i>God doesn’t kill children to test our faith</i>, the worried pastor said. <i>What about Job?</i> she snapped. My uncle sat in the treehouse for days, mutely drinking spirits. My aunt would come over each night to be fed, to be with people who washed and were sober. She hugged me very tightly, and she told me she loved me a lot, and when no one was looking she pinched me. Hard. She grabbed a fold of skin between her finger and thumb and dug in with the nail so it marked. I looked at her eyes and she meant it. A test. <i>I dare you to fucking scream.</i></p>
